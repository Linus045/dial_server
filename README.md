# DIAL Server
The main goal of this project is to better understand uPNP and the DIAL protocol.
The plan is to create a simple DIAL server thats running on my PC that can be used to receive requests from my phone (e.g. Spotify play requests or Youtube play requests) and 
then open Firefox or whatever to play them.
